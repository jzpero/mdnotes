I've created these notes as I go through my medical school and core Internal Medicine residency training in Canada.

These notes are not necessarily updated nor up-to-date; please refer to them for education purposes only. They are meant to be a source of high-yield reference information and not comprehensive textbook-level notes. I am not responsible for the clinical care derived from information found here.
