Liberation from mechanical ventilation
======================================

Steps for liberation
--------------------

1.  Optimize conditions
2.  Assess readiness for extubation/spontaneous breathing trial (SBTs)
3.  Conduct SBT daily with sedation holiday  
    
4.  Extubate if passes SBT
    1.  to room air
    2.  to NIV

Conditions need to be optimized
-------------------------------

*   respiratory  
    *   FiO2 < 40-50%
    *   PEEP < 5-10 cm (more if obese)
        *   can always extubate to CPAP if concerned about precipitating pulmonary edema
    *   normal PaCO2 or etCO2
    *   patient-triggered mode (e.g. PSV)
*   cardiovascular
    *   stable perfusion
    *   stable heart rate
    *   not on high level vasopressors
*   neuro
    *   arousable
    *   ideally following commands (e.g. minimal sedation)
*   renal
    *   no uncontrolled acid-base physiology
*   gastrointestinal
    *   NG feeds off for approx 6 hours or so. Due to risk of aspiration with elective airway procedure.
*   underlying issue is resolved or managed

Assessment of readiness for extubation/SBT
------------------------------------------

*   LOC satisfactory, and cooperative. Can they protect their airway?
*   Can lift their head off the pillow, and arms off the bed. Do they have ICUAW?
*   Adequate cough with tracheal suctioning.
*   Adequate gag with oropharyngeal suctioning.
*   good tidal volumes with zero pressure support (>10 mL/kg IBW)
*   Can overcome -20 cmH2O pressure trigger (adequate MIP). Can they generate enough negative pressure?
*   Satisfactory audible/measured cuff leak. Presence of cuff leak predicts success. Absence of cuff leak may not predict failed extubation. See below.
*   RSBI
    *   classical RSBI per [Yang-Tobin study (1991)](https://dx.doi.org/%2010.1056/NEJM199105233242101):
        *   T-piece
        *   first minute of SBT
        *   spirometer used
        *   resp rate (f) divided by VT in litres.
    *   [Zhang et al 2014](https://journals.lww.com/amjmedsci/Abstract/2014/10000/Comparison_of_Pressure_Support_Ventilation_and.7.aspx) suggest you can use PSV 5/5-7 with a threshold of 75 to predict extubation failure

Daily Spontaneous Breathing Trials
----------------------------------

Essentially, an SBT is the process of taking a still-intubated patient and then simulating the workload of spontaneous extubated breathing with the tube still in situ.

*   often use is PS 5/5 to try to cancel out the resistance of the ETT. Consider CPAP 5 with ATC, or PS 8/0 as valid alternatives.
*   adequate oxygenation
*   adequate ventilation
*   no signs of severe fatigue
    *   accessory muscle use, diaphoresis
    *   high RSBI (Yang-Tobin study) > 105
*   no other obvious complications from SBT (arrhythmia, bradycardia, hypotension, severe hypertension)
*   best done in conjunction with sedation holiday
*   duration 30 minutes at least, up to 120 minutes

Address Potential Cuff Leak

Extubation to Respiratory Support
---------------------------------

*   Consider extubating to HFNC for most patients.
*   Patients with COPD, CHF, OSA may benefit from CPAP/BiPAP after extubation as opposed to HFNC.
