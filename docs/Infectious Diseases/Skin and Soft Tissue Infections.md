# Skin and Soft Tissue Infections
## Types of Skin and Soft Tissue Infections
- Erysipelas (i.e. sharply demarcated borders)
- Cellulitus
- Necrotizing soft tissue infection (includes necrotizing fasciitis)

## Diagnosis
These are generally clinical diagnoses, suspected when patients present with red, hot, painful areas of soft tissue. The timeframe is generally acute. There may or may not be purulence or abscesses. There may or may not be a history of local laceration, injury, puncture wound, etc. that served as a locus of infection.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a surgical diagnosis theoretically made in the OR. In reality, it is often confirmed using CT imaging to detect deep-tissue gas. Certain signs may be associated with necrotizing fasciitis:

## When to Culture?
Culture only with purulence (i.e. when you can get an actual fluid sample). Yield is low in cellulitis overall (30%) and contamination is likely, limiting the utility of such tests.

## Likely Organisms
Erysipelas and Cellulitus:
*MSSA, MRSA, GAS*

Necrotizing STI/Fasciitis:

- Type 1:
- Type 2:
- Type 3:

## Antimicrobial Therapy
### Considerations

- Most cases require empiric coverage of MSSA and Group A Strep.
- Empiric coverage of MRSA should only be done in certain cases described below.
- Initial duration should be 7-14 days.
- PO route can be done if afebrile for 2 days
- Adjust according to cultures, but start broad.

### Oral Regimens

| Drug        | Regimen                 | Coverage  |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| Cephalexin  | 500 mg PO QID           | GAS, MSSA |
| TMP-SMX     | 1-2 DS tabs divided BID | MRSA      |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg PO BID           | MRSA      | 

### Parenteral Regimens

## Surgical Therapy
Indicated for necrotizing fasciitis.

## Adjunct Therapy
- Reduce edema via elevation and/or compression stockings.

- Treat overlying fungal infections as they present a portal of entry for pathogens.
