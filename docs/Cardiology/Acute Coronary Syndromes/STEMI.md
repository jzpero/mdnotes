# STEMI
## Diagnosis

1. EKG changes (more acutely diagnostic)
2. +/- cardiac biomarkers
    1.  troponin I and troponin T are isoformically specific to the heart
    2. sensitive to myocardial injury, not infarction
    3. serial troponins recommended (3 hours with hsTn)

## Management
### Supportive

1. Oxygen > 90% or if in respiratory failure or distress, or high risk for hypoxia

### Reperfusion
Time = muscle. Two choices: (1) fibrinolysis (2) primary PCI.

### Subsequent/Concurrent Therapy
1. **Antiplatelet therapy.**
    1. **ASA 160 mg PO**, crushed or chewed. Continue with 81 mg PO daily thereafter
    2. **P2Y12 receptor inhibitor**
        1. Unless undergoing fibrinolysis, use ticagrelor > prasugrel.
        2. If undergoing fibrinolysis, then use clopidogrel.
2. **Anticoagulant therapy.** Depends on reperfusion method.
    1. Fibrinolysis
        1. Enoxaparin
        2. UFH 60 units/kg (max 4,000) then 12 units/kg/hr IV, target aPTT 50-70s
    2. Primary PCI
        1. UFH 70 to 100 units/kg (max 10,000) + more to target ACT >250s if no GP inhibitor.
        2. Can consider bivalirudin if received ticagrelor or prasgugrel
    3. No reperfusion
        1. UFH 50 to 70 units/kg up to a maximum of 5000 units, to be followed by an IV drip of 12 units/kg per hour, with a goal aPTT of 1.5 to 2 times control or approximately 50 to 75 seconds
        2. Enoxaparin
3. **Beta blockers.** Give to all patients with acute STEMI if there are no contraindications, which are: heart failure, low output state, risk for cardiogenic shhock, bradycardia, AV block, reactive airway disease. The evidence supports a duration of up to three years in lower-risk patients. Oral cardioselective (MAN-BABE) medications preferred over intravenous beta blockade.
    1. Metoprolol tartrate 25 - 50 mg q6 - 12 hours
    2. Atenolol 25 - 50 mg BID
    3. Closer to discharge, change to longer-acting beta blockers.
    4. Target discharge HR = 70.
    5. Consider IV beta blockade if hemodynamically stable and you need to address ongoing ischemia quickly.
4. **Cholesterol-lowering therapy.** Intensive statin therapy improves outcomes in all patients with STEMI. LDL-C target is 1.29 mM. The intensity, not the specific agent used, is the determinant of clinical outcomes.
    1. If not on a statin, start high-intensity statin such as atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 20-40 mg.
    2. Intensify statin therapy for those already on moderate dose statins.
    3. If already on high-intensity statin, add ezetimibe 10 mg daily (IMPROVE-IT, 2015)[^1]. Alternatively, add this medication when starting statins for patients with very high LDL.
    4. Consider PCSK9 inhibitors if necessary to reach this target.
    5. *Essentially, use statins and non-statins to aggressively control LDL-C*
