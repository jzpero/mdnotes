Untreated, the ventricular rate tends to be rapid and variable in the range of 120-160 bpm. AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia. Risk factors can be divided into modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors: Modifiable Non-Modifiable hypertension obesity obstructive sleep apnea diabetes mellitus chronic kidney disease heavy alcohol use age (>95% of patients are 60 or older) male sex underlying cardiac disease Caucasian race Triggers of atrial fibrillation are varied: Category Causes Cardiovascular ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, hypertension, pericardial disease, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism Conduction pre-excitation syndromes Metabolic thyrotoxicosis, electrolyte abnormalities (hypoK, hypoMg), acid-base abnormalities Systemic acute infection, surgery Ingestion acute alcohol consumption, sympathomimetics, digoxin, theophylline, adenosine Caffeine is not associated with atrial fibrillation. EKG findings are an irregularly irregular rhythm, no P waves, no isoelectric baseline, variable ventricular rate, narrow QRS (usually), and possibly fine/coarse high-frequency fibrillatory waves (which may mimic P waves). The ventricular rate is often 110 to 160 bpm, and if it is above 100 then it is AF with rapid ventricular response a.k.a. \u201cAFRVR\u201d. Pathophysiology Classically, AF can be a progressive condition that involves cardiac myocyte remodeling, fibrosis, and conduction abnormalities. Atrial dilatation, commonly seen in longstanding systemic hypertension, predisposes to ectopic atrial automaticity and abnormal electrical activity. Atrial fibrillation promotes atrial fibrillation. Classification Definition Process Subclinical AF (SCAF) \u201cAsymptomatic episodes of AF detected by intracardiac, implantable, or wearable monitors and confirmed by intracardiac electrogram or review of the recorded rhythm on the electrocardiogram.\u201d Unknown. Associated with progression to clinical AF, and with a risk of stroke. Paroxysmal AF Self-limiting, resolves within 7 days Re-entry mechanism involving atrial muscle extending into the pulmonary veins (PVs). Persistent AF Lasts more than 7 days, or does not spontaneously resolve. May involve the PVs, SVC, or the coronary sinus. Gradual fibrosis. Long-standing AF Uninterrupted for more than 1 year Chronic atrial fibrosis, and difficult to restore and maintain normal sinus rhythm. Permanent AF Cannot return to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) Irreversible electrophysiological remodeling. Consequences Loss of proper atrial contributions to ventricular filling promotes atrial hemostasis with predisposition to left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus formation . Thromboembolic cerebrovascular disease results. Rapid ventricular rates can cause hemodynamic collapse , or heart failure exacerbations . This is particularly true with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Over time, uncontrolled AF can lead to tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy. Otherwise, symptoms related to inconsistent cardiac output might include fatigability, exercise intolerance, dizziness, and syncope. Why do we care if someone has AF? Because over time, it significantly increases the risk of serious and potentially irreversible conditions: mortality (by 1.5-1.9x) heart failure stroke (by 5x, causes 25% of strokes) dementia and vascular dementia Chronic Management of Atrial Fibrillation In general, patients who maintain sinus rhythm have better survival than those who continue to have AF. Therapy focuses on controlling the ventricular response to disordered atrial contractions, and reducing the risk of thromboembolic disease. Rate versus Rhythm Control In 2002, the AFFIRM trial (NEJM 2002) compared rate control strategies (beta blockers, non-DHP CCBs, digoxin; target HR <80 at rest and <110 during 6-min walk test) to rhythm control strategies (amiodarone, disopyramide, flecainide, moricizine, procainamide, propafenone, quinidine, sotalol, dofetilide, and cardioversion) in patients 65 or older with chronic non-valvular AF, and eligible for anticoagulation with warfarin (target INR 2-3). Patients with rhythm control were encouraged to be on anticoagulation but were allowed to not be anticoagulated if NSR had been sustained for at least 4 (ideally 12) consecutive weeks. Patients with rate control had to be on constant anticoagulation. Overall, there was no survival differences between rate and rhythm approaches, but rhythm control trended towards increased mortality, especially in the elderly and those with no history of heart failure. There were fewer adverse drug effects with rate control. Hint Consider rhythm control if young and asymptomatic with no structural heart disease. Consider rate control if older with structural heart disease or a dilated left atrium. Rate Control Goal: HR less than 100 at rest, according to the CCS Guidelines. However, the RACE II trial (NEJM 2010) demonstrated that, over three years with a broad CV composite outcome, a lenient rate target (resting HR <110 bpm) was noninferior to a strict rate control target (resting HR < 80 bpm and <110 bpm during moderate exercise). Not only that, but a lenient target increased the target success rate, decreased visits necessary to reach the target, decreased the number of patients on medications at all, and decreased the dosages of beta blockers, verapamil, and combination therapy. The RACE II (2010) trial supports a lenient heart rate approach (<110 bpm at rest) in active patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Common agents include: beta blockers (metoprolol, bisoprolol, etc), non-DHP CCBs (diltiazem, verapamil), digoxin (lacks negative inotropic effects, may be useful in heart failure). Beta blockers are first-line therapy regardless of history of myocardial infarction or LV dysfunction. Non-DHP CCBs are first-line as well with no history of MI or LV dysfunction. They are less preferred than BBs in the setting of CAD. Avoid in heart failure. Digoxin is an option in those with LV systolic dysfunction, or if very sedentary. It is also used as add-on or second-line therapy to BBs and non-DHP CCBs. Amiodarone is used in exceptional cases. Dronedarone should not be used in permanent AF, or for the sole purpose of rate control. As well, do not use with history of heart failure or LVEF < 40%. Be cautious if also using digoxin. AV node ablation or a permanent pacemaker may be needed if maximum pharmacologic therapy fails to control rate. Rhythm Control Risk Stratification Most patients will warrant chronic anticoagulation. It is particularly indicated for those with mitral stenosis , HCM , and prior stroke . Otherwise, we tend to use clinical decision rules and risk stratification scores to make these decisions. Risk of Stroke The CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score has been used to estimate stroke risk in nonvalvular AF, and to make recommendations about chronic anticoagulation. Whether the AF is paroxysmal or persistent or not doesn\u2019t seem to make a large difference in terms of stroke risk. Long-term anticoagulation is indicated for women with score of 2 or more, and for men with a score of 3 or more. {% hint style=\u201dinfo\u201d %} Valvular AF is generally accepted to refer to atrial fibrillation with rheumatic heart disease (mainly mitral stenosis) and artificial heart valves. CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc Score Estimated Annual Stroke Rate (%) 0 0 1 1.3 2 2.2 3 3.2 4 4.0 5 6.7 6-9 >9 {% hint style=\u201dinfo\u201d %} The annual risk of stroke starts at 0, and increases by approximately 1% for each point (until 4, after which it increases dramatically). In Canada, the recent CHADS65 algorithm has supplanted previous scores in determining if patients should be on chronic anticoagulation. This has greatly simplified decision making. Of course, therapy must always be guided by patient preferences and individual circumstances. Risk of Bleeding Any anticoagulant therapy increases the risk of bleeding; that is the nature of the mechanism. The HAS-BLED score estimates the risk of major bleeds. A score of 3 or more is considered high risk, and indicates close monitoring and followup. Anticoagulation Warfarin has long been the standard anticoagulant for atrial fibrillation, and it remains the therapy of choice for those with mitral stenosis and mechanical heart valves. It is an epoxide reductase inhibitor that interferes with the activation of vitamin K in the body, mostly in the liver. It is particularly cheap, but requires monthly INR checks and has many drug-drug interactions. Onset of action is over several (3-5) days as enzyme inhibition does not have immediate effects of coagulation factors. Immediate reversal consists of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC/Octaplex; coag factors 2, 7, 9, 10 and proteins C and S), fresh frozen plasma, and vitamin K. Vitamin K-dependent proteins are: coagulation factors 2, 7, 9, 10; proteins C and S Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are newer inhibitors of coagulation factors that are more expensive and more convenient. DOACs are noninferior to warfarin in individual head-to-head trials for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and may actually be superior by a small margin for reduction of mortality, stroke, major bleeds, and intracranial hemorrhage. No DOACs have been directly compared so far. In severe renal disease, consider warfarin. Otherwise, adjust dosages with tools such as Thrombosis Canada\u2019s Dosing Tool . Often, elderly patients are often inappropriately underdosed, meaning that they do not receive the proven benefits of anticoagulation, while receiving some of the bleeding risk.

Toxic dose >10 g or >200 mg/kg as single ingestion or over 24hr period OR >6 g or >150 mg/kg per 24hr period x 2days \u201c massive ingestion \u201d has variable definitions but might be >500 mg/kg or known ingestion >32 grams Absorption A single ingestion of oral acetaminophen is generally completely absorbed by 4 hours post ingestion. Absorption is delayed (!) with some medications that delay gut motility Anticholinergics Opioids Kinetics 100% bioavailable 20% bound to serum proteins VD = 0.85 L/kg Elimination half-life 2.5 hours Metabolism Pathways of metabolism: Glucuronidation (50%) Sulfation (30%) CYP (10%) Acetaminophen \u2013> NAPQI, a toxic metabolite NAPQI + glutathione \u2013> renal excretion Direct renal clearance (10%) Toxicity NAPQI via the CYP system is usually detoxified via hepatic glutathione to a metabolite that is renally excreted. Overdose leads to increased NAPQI generation, depleting intracellular glutathione. When stores of this <30% of normal, NAPQI then binds to other hepatic macromolecules, causing hepatic necrosis within 12 hours. The characteristic pattern is centrilobular necrosis Clinical Manifestations Excess NAPQI binds to hepatic macromolecules, causing hepatocellular necrosis and potentially SIRS, MODS, ARDS, death. Initial clinical findings are nonspecific and delayed. There are four classic stages of acetaminophen toxicity: Stage Timeframe Description 1 Up to 24 hours Asymptomatic in most patients. Possibly N/V, malaise, anorexia. hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis which correlates with a high 4-hour acetaminophen concentration. if there is a very severe ingestion (75-100 g) then patients might develop coma or severe lactic acidosis even on the first day, secondary to metabolic decoupling and not necessarily from hepatic damage . 2 2-3 days Improved Stage 1 symptoms. clinical signs of hepatotoxicity: - RUQ pain and tenderness - elevated aminotransferases - hypoglycemia - metabolic acidosis - elevated INR 3 3-4 days Progression to fulminant/peak hepatic failure - metabolic acidosis (lactic due to acute overdose) - coagulopathy - renal failure - encephalopathy - recurrent GI symptoms 4 2 weeks DEATH or slow recovery taking 1-3 months in survivors. Generally the recovery of hepatic function is quite remarkable if no transplantation is needed. Keys: Chronic HAGMA can develop from 5-oxoproline accumulation independent of acute hepatic damage. Peak liver damage is about days 2-3. Peak renal failure is about 1 week. Diagnostic Studies Serum acetaminophen level Measure at 4 hours unless previous level undetectable If 4-hour level borderline or there is suspected delayed absorption, repeat at 8 hours as well. Serum aminotransferases Renal function Bilirubin Lactate INR Phosphate level ABG Current Ontario Poison Centre recommendations are: Initial presentation 4 hour acetaminophen level ASA level Blood gases Electrolytes Glucose BUN, Creatinine, osmolality AST, ALT, INR Ethanol level Sustained-release or concurrent opioid/anticholinergics (extends the absorption dynamics) Repeat acetaminophen level q4h until peak, and then q12h until undetectable. Those receiving NAC Repeat VBG, lytes, glucose, BUN, Cr, AST, ALT, INT q12h. Repeat acetaminophen q12h until undetectable. Severe risk patients Lactate and lipase levels Phosphate levels if liver enzymes elevated repeat broad labs q4h until acetaminophen peaks and then q12h until it is undetectable. Treatment GI decontamination Consider early activated charcoal (1 g/kg) through PO or NG routes if possible within 1-2 hours. If extended-release formulation acetaminophen or massive ingestion, can give this past 2 hours. Consider even up to 4 hours. Do not give if sedated unless ETT in situ. Consider gastric lavage if presenting within 1 hour of massive ingestion N-acetylcysteine [NAC] (the antidote) NAC is nearly 100% effective in prevention of hepatotoxicity if given within 8 hours of acute ingestion Mechanism (1) acutely, prevents NAPQI toxicity via glutathione repletion or via direct reduction back to acetaminophen (2) afterwards, decreases hepatic necrosis via antioxidant effects, antineutrophil effect, increased tissue oxygen delivery Route IV administration is preferred over PO route esp in Canada. Indication is depending on the nomogram and timeframe: No further acetaminophen serum measurements are necessary once the need for acetylcysteine therapy has been determined until the completion of the course of therapy.

Minimizing Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury ARDSNet changed practice towards low-volume and low-pressure ventilation. Injury can arise from \u201cvolutrauma\u201d, \u201catelectrauma\u201d which lead to inflammation and alveolar injury. Low VT ventilation (6 mL/kg PBW) and low airway pressures (Pplateau < 30 cm H2O) were shown in ARDSNet to reduce mortality by 40%, and these strategies are now commonly used. Optimize PEEP Reduced compliance means that end-expiration alveolar collase can occur without increases in end-expiratory pressures. Increase PEEP to minimize FiO2 and optimize PaO2 , there is no consensus on how to do this. Methods include: ARDSNet tables of PEEP-FiO2 combinations generating a static pressure-volume curve for the respiratory system and setting PEEP at the lower inflection point on this curve to maximize respiratory system compliance Prone Positioning PROSEVA 2013: In severe ARDS (PF < 150), early prolonged proned positioning decreases 28 and 90 day mortality by 60% and by 56% respectively as compared to semirecumbent \u201csupine\u201d positioning. Earlier studies show this also improves arterial oxygenation (PaO2) Other Strategies in Mechanical Ventilation Recruitment maneuvers can increase PEEP and oxygenation but have not been shown to reduce mortality. ART trial (2017) PHARLAP (2019) Alternate ventilation modes such as APRV and HFOV have not proven beneficial ECMO improves mortality and may serve as rescue therapy. Steroids in ARDS Based on the 2017 and 2019 guidelines for ARDS, few studies have shown significant mortality benefit. They not support the routine use of glucocorticoids in ARDS. However, in 2020 the ARDSNet group published the first dexamethasone trial of ARDS, the DEXA-ARDS trial, in the Lancet. This study showed that in early moderate to severe ARDS (PF < 200), ten days of dexamethasone (20 g for five days then 10 mg for five days) in addition to lung-protective ventilation decreased 60-day mortality by 15% absolute difference (21% vs 36%), increased ventilator-free days at 28 days by 4.8 days. Less proning was needed for dexamethasone arm. There were no significant adverse effects compared to control with respect to hyperglycemia, new infections in the ICU, or barotrauma. N=277, and this trial wssas stopped early for efficacy. In moderate to severe ARDS, 10 days of dexamethasone reduces mortality by 15% absolute risk (NNT = 6), and increases ventilator-free days within 28 days by 5 days on average. Oxygen Targets in ARDS In the LOCO2 trial (NEJM 2020), a conservative oxygen target may have increased mortality compared to a liberal oxygen target for patients with ARDS. Based on the results of this trial, and ICU-ROX (NEJM 2020), suggest a liberal SpO2 target > 96% . LOCO2 At day 28, a total of 34 of 99 patients (34.3%) in the conservative-oxygen group and 27 of 102 patients (26.5%) in the liberal-oxygen group had died (difference, 7.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], \u22124.8 to 20.6). Among patients with ARDS, early exposure to a conservative-oxygenation strategy with a Pao2 between 55 and 70 mm Hg did not increase survival at 28 days Given the results of the LOCO2 trial, the lower range of the Spo2 target in any conservative strategy, especially in patients requiring a high level of Fio2, should perhaps be 90%, as was used in ICU-ROX, rather than 88%. Fluid Management in ARDS Propensity to have increased interstitial and alveolar protein-rich fluid that worsens inflammation and oxygenation. Maintain low left atrial filling pressure to minimize pulmonary edema, preserve oxygenation and lung compliance, improve pulmonary mechanics, shorten ICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation The FACTT trial (\u201cComparison of Two Fluid-Management Strategies in Acute Lung Injury\u201d) suggests that conservative fluid management (i.e., net-neutral) compared to liberal-strategy (+ 1 litre per day on average) improves lung functional and shortens mechanical ventilation and critical care, without increasing non-pulmonary organ failure. The 2006 Fluids and Catheters Treatment Trial (FACTT) sought to define the optimal fluid management strategy in ALI/ARDS. It randomized 1,000 patients with ALI/ARDS to liberal (CVP 10-14) or conservative (CVP <4) fluid management strategies. At 60 days, there was no difference between the two groups in mortality. However, the conservative therapy was associated with a decreased days on a ventilator and time in the ICU. Fluid restriction Diuretics Limited only by hypotension and end-organ hypoperfusion Neuromuscular Blockade in ARDS See: Neuromuscular Blockade . In severe ARDS, sedation alone can be inadequate for the patient-ventilator synchrony required for lung-protective ventilation. ACURASYS (2010) showed a mortality and ventilation-dependence benefit with 48h of cisatracurium in severe ARDS. ROSE (2019) demonstrated that this approach in conjunction with modern light sedation protocols did not reduce mortality, and was associated with an increase in ICU-acquired weakness and serious adverse cardiovascular events. Therefore, do not routinely use neuromuscular blockade for severe ARDS. Other Therapies Pulmonary surfactants not shown to work. Pulmonary vasodilators such as inhaled NO, not shown to work.

In support modes, the patient initiates the breath but the work is partially offset. inspiratory breath characteristics trigger - what is the variable the initiates the breath? Time (ventilator-triggered) or flow or pressure change (patient-triggered). limit/target - the pressure, volume, or flow target during inspiration. cycle - the variable the ends the inspiratory phase and signals the start of passive expiratory gas flow. This can be time, tidal volume, or decrease in flow to a percentage of the peak inspiratory flow. Controlled Modes of Ventilation Volume Control Ventilation (VCV) Volume limited and time-cycled. Predetermined tidal volume at set respiratory rate. Flow is usually a square waveform but can be decelerating or sinusoidal. Peak inspiratory flow or inspiratory time is set and determines the duration of inspiration. Guarantees minute ventilation; airway presures can vary based on the mechanics of the respiratory system. Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV) Pressure limited and time-cycled. Tidal volume is the dependent variable and changes based on the mechanics. Target pressure is achieved and flow then decelerates to maintain a constant pressure profile for the inspiratory time. High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation (HFOV) Constant distending pressure (mean airway pressure MAP) is generated. Active inspiration and expiration with very small tidal volumes at 3-10 Hz (180 to 600 breaths per minute). Not been shown to improve mortality in ARDS with this lung-protective strategy. Assisted Modes of Ventilation Assist Control Ventilation Etiher pressure or volume-limited. Essentially this is PCV or VCV except the patient may trigger the ventilator for any or all breaths. The breaths are delivered according to the pressure/volume settings. Guarantees a minimum number of breaths, and if the patient is not breathing this is indistinguishable from PCV or VCV. Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) Pressure limited and flow-cycled. Patient determines the respiratory rate and each breath is patient-triggered. Patient effort triggers gas flow increase until the pressure support level is reached. When inspiratory flow decreaes below a threshold, then the ventilator cycles to expiration. Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) This is a time-cycled mode that alternates between two levels of airway pressure (Phigh and Plow). Most time is spent at Phigh to maintain alveolar recruitment, with brief cycling (<1 second) to Plow to allow for ventilation. The patient is meant to breath throughout the respiratory cycle (superimposed). Proportional Assist Ventilation Patient-triggered. Not limited by pressure, flow, or volume. The ventilator calculates using the respiratory mechanics the amount of flow and volume assistance for each breath, and targets a proportion of work that will be provided by the ventilator in each breath. The rest of the work is done by the patient. For example PAV 50% means that 50% of the work will be assisted by the ventilator. May improve patient-ventilator synchrony. PEEP/CPAP The pressure above atmospheric pressure that is maintained in the respiratory system throughout the entire cycle. That is, it is the airway pressure in the alveoli at the end of full expiration. Can maintain alveolar recruitment. Benefits of PEEP: improved oxygenation by reducing atelectasis and intrapulmonary shunting, decrease lung injury by minimizing cyclic alveolar collapse, increased FRC, improved compliance. Negative effects of PEEP: barotrauma, compression of blood vessels leading to increased physiologic dead space, shunt fraction, and decreased pulmonary blood flow. PEEP can also lead to hemodynamic effects secondary to increased intrahtoracic pressure: decreased RV preload, decreased LV afterload, and ultimately decreased cardiac output. Lung-Protective Ventilatory Strategies Ventilation can cause various mechanisms of lung trauma (1) barotrauma (2) volutrauma (3) atelectrauma (4) biotrauma which overall are termed \u201cventilator induced lung injury\u201d (VILI). A lung-protective strategy aims to limit lung stress and strain (tidal voolumes, plateau pressures), and maintain PEEP to keep the lung recruited and to minimize atelectrauma. Low tidal volume ventilation Generally used and proven in ARDS - see ARDSNet trial. May resolve in hypercapnia (can usually tolerate this in a permissive hypercapnic strategy ). PEEP Optimal level of PEEP as part of a lung-protective strategy in ARDS is not definitely established. The ALVEOLI, LOVS, and Express trials failed to demonstrate a significant mortality benefit with higher PEEP, but higher PEEP patients overall required fewer rescue interventions for refractory hypoxemia. In meta-analysis, patients with ARDS at baseline (PF < 200) and higher PEEP were more likely to survive to hospital discharge. Patients with more severe ARDS may benefit from higher PEEP. Titrating PEEP PEEP titration Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) Esophageal ballooon manometry HFOV The OSCAR and OSCILLATE trials studied HFOV in ARDS - overall no mortality benefit in OSCAR, and actually showed increased mortality in OSCILLATE.

Trial Details Clinical Context Previous trials had demonstrated that proning improved oxygenation in ARDS, but this did not translate to clinical outcomes. Meta-analyses suggested that survival was improved with severe hypoxemia secondary to ARDS. Population Patients with ARDS for less than 36 hours Mechanically ventilated with severe ARDS: PEEP > 5 cm H2O and PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mmHg, FiO2 > 0.6, and VT about 6 mg/kg PBW (per ARDSNet) Stabilization period of 12 to 24 hours Design 26 ICUs in France and 1 in Spain, experienced with proning Centralized and stratified randomization Data collectors not blinded, but adjudicators blinded Intervention Prone group: turned to prone within 1 hour of randomization Completely prone for at least 16 consecutive hours Standard ICU beds Criteria for stopping prone treatment: Improvement in PF ratio > 150 with PEEP < 10 and FiO2 < 0.6 at least 4 hours after end of last prone session Decrease in PF ration of more than 20% relative to the raion in the supine position before two consecutive prone sessions Complications during proning\u2026 Nonscheduled extubation Main stem bronchus intubation ETT obstruction Hemoptysis SpO2 < 85% or PaO2 < 55 mmHg on FiO2 1.0 Cardiac arrest Sustained bradycardia Sustained hypotension After patients in the prone group were turned to the supine position, the prone session could be resumed at any time before the planned assessment at 4 hours in the supine position if the criteria for oxygen saturation level, PaO2, or both were met Comparator Semirecumbent position in the \u201csupine group\u201d Patients in the supine group could not be crossed over to the prone group except as a rescue measure Ventilation Volume-controlled mode, constant inspiratory flow VT target 6 mL/kg PBW and PEEP via PEEP-FiO2 table Goal to maintain Pplat < 30 cm H2O, and arterial plasma pH 7.20 to 7.45 Weaning from mechanical ventilation was conducted in the same way for both groups Outcomes 28 day mortality Secondary outcomes 90 day mortality Successful extubation Time to successful extubation ICU LOS Complications NIV Tracheotomy rate Days free from organ dysfunction Ventilatory settings, ABG, and respiratory mechanics Results A total of 237 patients were assigned to the prone group, and 229 patients were assigned to the supine group. The 28-day mortality was 16.0% in the prone group and 32.8% in the supine group (P<0.001). The hazard ratio for death with prone positioning was 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.63). Unadjusted 90-day mortality was 23.6% in the prone group versus 41.0% in the supine group (P<0.001), with a hazard ratio of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.67).

This is enterohepatic recirculation. Excess urobilinogen reaches the systemic circulation where it is cleared by the kidneys.

Classically, \u201cdirect\u201d = conjugated, although this is inaccurate and just an approximation. About 10-20% of bilirubin gives a \u201cdirect\u201d reaction although only <5% of bilirubin is normally conjugated. Therefore, consider <15% direct as essentially all unconjugated . When >15%, a dipstick for bilirubinuria can clarify the situation as unconjugated bilirubin is not excreted in urine due to tight binding to albumin. Conjugated bilirubin is easily excreted; bilirubinuria is ALWAYS pathologic . Prolonged conjugated hyperbilirubinemia can lead to delta-bilirubin formaiton which is covalent bonding to albumin, which has a half-life of 14 to 12 days.

All bind to and inhibit PBPs, enzymes important for cross-linking bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans. Prevents cross linkage of the cell wall peptigoglycans, leading to loss of bacterial cell wall integrity. All require active bacterial growth for bacteriocidal action. Penicillins Penicillin Class Examples Description Natural penicillins penicillin G Narrow spectrum, short half lives, mostly IV or IM, well-distributed through the body. Aminopenicillins amoxicillin, ampicillin Broader spectrum then natural pcns. Can be given orally due to modifications that protect against stomach acids. Higher peak levels means longer dosing interval. Penicillinase-resistant penicillins oxacillin, nafcillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin Hepatic clearance, but same short half life means q4h dosing. Very narrow spectrum. Ureidopenicillins piperacillin Intrinsic resistance to many beta-lactamases. Short half life. Covers GN, Pseudomonas, MSSA. Cephalosporins Generation Examples Description I cefazolin, cephalexin, cefadroxil Predominantly effective against Gram-positive cocci. Frequently used for MSSA/GAS soft tissue infections, surgical prophylaxis, impetigo. II cefuroxime, cefprozil Increased activity against aerobics and anaerobic GNB. Effective against MSSA and non-enterococcal Strep. III ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefixime Enhanced GNB activity, does not cover SPICE organisms. Ceftazidime covers Pseudomonas .

Endothelial injury allows for either direct infection or formation of a nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) which can become infected during transient bacteremia. More virulent bugs tend to adhere directly to the endothelium. Other bugs tend to adhere to the NBTE. Risk factors for NBTE are valvular defects (MR, AS, AR), VSD, CHD, hypercoagulable states (marantic endocarditis), SLE, and antiphospholipid syndrome. Organisms deep within the vegetation are metabolically inactive and difficult to eradicate. Embolization of vegetation fragments can lead to distant infection or infarction. Intracardiac structures can be damaged (perivalvular abscesses, conduction blocks), and tissue damage arises from immune complex deposition or responses to deposited bacterial antigens. Risk factors are fairly obvious: congenital heart diseases chronic rheumatic heart disease IV drug use degenerative valves intracardiac devices (ICD, pacemaker, etc) old age prosthetic valves bioprosthetics and mechanicals have similar risk profiles risk is greatest in the first 6 to 12 mo risk declines to a low, stable level after Causative organisms are typically bacteria, but can be fungal as well.

Endothelial injury allows for either direct infection or formation of a nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) which can become infected during transient bacteremia. More virulent bugs tend to adhere directly to the endothelium. Other bugs tend to adhere to the NBTE. Risk factors for NBTE are valvular defects (MR, AS, AR), VSD, CHD, hypercoagulable states (marantic endocarditis), SLE, and antiphospholipid syndrome. Organisms deep within the vegetation are metabolically inactive and difficult to eradicate. Embolization of vegetation fragments can lead to distant infection or infarction. Intracardiac structures can be damaged (perivalvular abscesses, conduction blocks), and tissue damage arises from immune complex deposition or responses to deposited bacterial antigens.

From the bite of the Ixodes scapularis or Ixodes pacificus tick. The geographic distribution of the infection follows that of its vectors, with cases predominantly occurring in the Northeast, Midwest, and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and southern Canada. The incidence typically peaks in the summer months, when ticks are most active. In patients with anaplasmosis, the spectrum of illness ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe disease that requires intensive care.

Risk Factors Major RF are age (65+), baseline cognitive dysfunction or dementia (MMSE > 24), sensory deprivation, poor overall health, infection and acute illness (APACHE II > 16), surgery, pain, poor vision (<20/70), dehydration. Major precipitating factors are physical restraint, Foley catheter, malnutrition, new medications, iatrogenic events. Outcomes Increases LOS, infections, functional decline, institutionalization, recidivism. High mortality risk, about 25-33% in-hospital. Associated with persistent cognitive dysfunction. Pathogenesis Occurs from widespread disturbances in cortical and subcortical brain regions with diffuse cerebral dysfunction. This is a result of an insult to a predisposed individual .

Etiology Onset is 1-2 weeks after immune stimulation. s/p acute infectious process (70%) usually respiratory or GI infection 20-30% of cases are due to Campylobacter jejuni Other common inciting pathogens are a HHV infection such as EBV or CMV, HIV, hepatitis E, influenza A, arboviruses (Zika virus, Chikungunya), Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae s/p vaccination H1N1 influenza vaccine Semple Rabies vaccine lupus lymphoma Pathogenesis/Immunology Essentially, this is an autoimmune process leading to acute neuropathy which can be either (1) demyelinating or (2) axonal (motor or sensory) in type. This process is likely antibody-mediated, driven by molecular mimicry between microbial and cellular surface antigens. The axonal neuropathy subtypes are more associated with anti-GM1 and anti-GD1a IgG autoantibodies.

This is a neurological emergency. After five minutes it\u2019s less likely to spontaneously terminate and be controlled with medications. After 5 minutes, decreases in GABA and increases in glutamine and NMDA receptors leads to ongoing decreased seizure threshold. Can be nonconvulsive where the patient is comatose or has fluctuating mental status or confusion, with no overt seizure activity. This diagnosis is difficult and typically made by EEG. Suggested by: prolonged postictal period after generalized seizure, subtle motor signs, fluctuating AMS, unexplained stupor and confusion. Causes of Status Epilepticus Consider the following: Subtherapeutic antiepileptic levels Preexisting neurologic conditions Acute stroke Hypoxia/anoxia Metabolic abnormalities ETOH or drug intoxication/withdrawal Treatment of Status Epilepticus Supportive Measures ABCs, glucose, IV access, fluids, temperature control Intubate if necessary Foley catheter, NG tube Treat underlying cause Established Status Epilepticus Benzodiazepines are first line. Lorazepam 2 -4 mg IV if you have IV access; otherwise, midazolam 10 mg IM is superior without IV access. Lorazepam does last longer (12-24 hours vs. 15 to 60 minutes) and is associated with fewer seizure recurrences. Longer-active antiepileptics should be given within 20 minutes of diagnosis to help prevent recurrence.
