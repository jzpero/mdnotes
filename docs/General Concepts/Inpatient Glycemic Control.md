# Inpatient Glycemic Control
## Glycemic Targets for Hospitalized Diabetics
| Population                 | BG Target (mM)                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Noncritically ill          | preprandial: 5.0-8.0; random: < 10.0 |
| Critically ill             | 6.0-10.0                             |
| Perioperatively (non-CABG) | 5.0-10.0                             |
| Acute coronary syndrome    | 7.0-10.0                             |
| L&D                        | 4.0-7.0                              | 

- consider lower targets if stable with Hx of successful tight outpatient glycemic control
- consider higher targets if terminally ill or with severe comorbidities
- modify antihyperglycemic therapy if BG < 3.9 unless easily explained (e.g. missed meal)

## Glucose Monitoring

If indicated, then the frequency should be about:
- AC and HS if eating;
- q4-6 h if NPO or with continuous enteral feeding;
- q1-2 h if on continuous IV insulin or critically ill.

Consider monitoring on glucose-altering interventions (glucocorticoids, octreotide, parenteral or enteral nutrition, etc).

CBG may be inaccurate in critically ill due to peripheral hypoperfusion.
