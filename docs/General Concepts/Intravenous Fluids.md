## Saline versus Ringer's Lactate
A pair of recent trials examined NS vs RL/balanced crystalloids in both critically ill and non-critically ill adult patients:

| SALT-ED (2018)[^1] |            |              |            | Among non-critically ill ED patients, initial fluid resuscitation with balanced crystalloids (Lactated Ringer's or Plasma-Lyte) does not reduce duration of hospitalization when compared to the isotonic crystalloid, normal saline. However, balanced crystalloid use is associated with a reduction in major kidney-related events. |

!!! tip "What crystalloid should be my pick?"
    In the absence of any major indications for normal saline, such as medication interactions, **Ringer's Lactate** should be the crystalloid of choice, especially if the patient is hyperchloremic. Theoretically in existing hyperkalemia, RL will equilibriate the serum potassium to 4 mmol/L. If renal kaliuresis is impaired then the potassium load *may* lead to accumulation.
    
Of note, the lactate in RL is sodium lactate, *not* lactic acid. It does not cause a lactic acidosis. Since it is a weak base (proton acceptor), it might actually buffer the pH a little (source need). Accumulation of the lactate may occur if the liver is unable to metabolize the lactate load. This may interfere with interpretation of lactate levels.
