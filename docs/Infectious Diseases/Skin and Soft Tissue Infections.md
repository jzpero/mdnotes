# Types of Skin and Soft Tissue Infections
- Erysipelas
- Cellulitus
- Necrotizing soft tissue infection (includes necrotizing fasciitis)

# When to Culture?
Culture only with purulent cellulitis only (i.e. when you can get an actual fluid sample). Yield is low in cellulitis overall (30%) and contamination is likely.

# Antimicrobial Therapy
- Considerations:
    - Most cases require empiric coverage of MSSA and Group A Strep.
    - Empiric coverage of MRSA should only be done in certain cases described below.
    - Initial duration should be 7-14 days.
    - PO route can be done if:
        - afebrile for 2 days
    - Adjust according to cultures, but start broad.
  - Oral Regimens:
    - Cephalexin 500 mg PO QID, for GAS and MSSA coverage
    - TMP-SMX 1-2 DS tabs divided BID, or doxycycline 100 mg PO BID, for MRSA coverage
- Parenteral Regiments:

# Adjunct Therapy
- Reduce edema via elevation and/or compression stockings.

- Treat overlying fungal infections as they present a portal of entry for pathogens.
