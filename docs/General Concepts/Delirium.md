# Delirium
## Definition

Clinical dx of **acute, fluctuating confusion/cognitive change**.
Classically consists of **attention deficit** with other symptoms such as altered sleep-wake cycles, hallucinations, delusions, changes in affect, and autonomic symptoms.
Can be **hyperactive** or **hypoactive**.

Delirium is a **CNS manifestation of usually a non-CNS problem. It is a medical emergency unless proven otherwise.**

## Risk Factors
Major RF are age (65+), baseline cognitive dysfunction or dementia (MMSE > 24), sensory deprivation, poor overall health, infection and acute illness (APACHE II > 16), surgery, pain, poor vision (<20/70)., dehydration.

Major precipitating factors are physical restraint, Foley catheter, malnutrition, new medications, iatrogenic events.

## Outcomes
Increases LOS, infections, functional decline, institutionalization, recidivism.

High mortality risk, about 25-33% in-hospital.

## Pathogenesis
Occurs from widespread disturbances in cortical and subcortical brain regions with diffuse cerebral dysfunction. This is a result of an **insult to a predisposed individual**.

Theories range from cholingeric failure hypotheses, to dopamine excess, to HPA axis stress response, to cytokines in inflammation.

## Etiology
| Category        | Example                                                                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **D**rugs       | Rx drugs, overdose/abuse, poisoning/toxidrome                                           |
| **I**nfection   | Pneumonia, UTI, skin, CNS, etc.                                                         |
| **M**etabolic   | electrolytes, glucose, temperature, oxygenation, liver and renal, thyroid, vitamins, hydration, nutrition |
| **E**nvironment | hospitalization, poor vision, etc.                                                      |
| **S**tructural  | CNS lesions, strokes, etc.                                                                                        |

Pay particular attention to:

- anticholinergics, narcotics, benzodiazepines
- drugs of abuse
- lytes and glucose
- calcium
- liver and renal status
- dehydration
- ANY infection
- thyroid
- end of life
- seizures

## Assessment
The **Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)** is a 4-question screen for delirium. It requires (1) and (2). It is 82% sens and 99% spec for delirium. It is the best bedside instrument for dx of delirium.
   

-   (1) acute onset and fluctuating course;
-   (2) inattention with either (3) or (4);
-   (3) disorganized thinking;
-   (4) altered LOC.

###  Inattention
 
 - serial 7s
 - digit span, forwards (5) or backwards (3)
 - counting backwards
 - months/days in reverse
 - WORLD backwards
 - hypervigilance tests

### Other Features

- perceptual disturbances
- altered sleep-wake cycle
- emotional lability
      

## Treatment

1) Rule out alternatives such as depression, dementia
2)  Treat reversible causes
3)  Supportive measures
    1)  sitter
    2)  family
    3)  sensory optimization
    4)  mobility
    5)  hydration
    6)  self-care
4)  **Pharmacotherapy** is indicated if they're a physical threat to themselves or other, interfering with necessary medical treatment to resolve the underlying cause, or with extreme patient emotional distress. It doesn't improve outcomes but can convert hyperactive to hypoactive delirium. Start LOW and go SLOW.
    1)  Haloperidol 0.25-0.5 mg IVSC/IM BID
    2)  Risperidone 0.25-0.5 mg PO BID
    3)  Olanzapine 2.5-5.0 mg PO daily
    4)  Quetiapine 6.25-25 mg PO BID/TID
  
With antipsychotics, keep in mind the risks of EPS, stroke, dysrhythmias like TdP/SCD, pneumonia, falls, incontinence, NMS.
