# Skin and Soft Tissue Infections
## Types of Skin and Soft Tissue Infections
- Erysipelas (i.e. sharply demarcated borders)
- Cellulitis
- Necrotizing soft tissue infection (includes necrotizing fasciitis)

## Diagnosis
These are generally clinical diagnoses, suspected when patients present with red, hot, painful areas of soft tissue. The timeframe is generally acute. There may or may not be purulence or abscesses. There may or may not be a history of local laceration, injury, puncture wound, etc. that served as a locus of infection.

Necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) is a clinical diagnosis theoretically made in the OR. In reality, it is often confirmed using CT imaging to detect deep-tissue gas. Certain signs may be associated with necrotizing STIs: bullae, crepitus, violaceous skin, gas on XR/CT, pain out of proportion, cutaneous anesthesia. The [LRINEC Score](https://www.mdcalc.com/lrinec-score-necrotizing-soft-tissue-infection) helps differentiate between NSTI and other STIs based on labs, but is not sensitive and therefore cannot rule out NSTI.

## When to Culture?
Culture only with purulence (i.e. when you can get an actual fluid sample). Yield is low in cellulitis overall (30%) and contamination is likely, limiting the utility of such tests.

## Likely Organisms
**Erysipelas and Cellulitis:**
*MSSA, MRSA, GAS*. Purulent tends to be GAS, nonpurulent tends to be Staphylococcus.

**Necrotizing STI:**

- Type 1, polymicrobial: Gram-positive cocci, Gram-negative rods, anaerobes. *Bacteroides*, *Clostridia*, *Prevotella*, *Peptostreptococcus*, *Pseudomonas*, *Enterobacteriaceae*. Patients tend to be older and more co-morbid. Includes "gase gangrene" which is *Clostridia perfringens*. Includes "Fournier's gangrene" of the perineal area.
- Type 2, monomicrobial: GAS +/- Staphylococcus. Patients are younger, healthier, and history of trauma/IVDU/surgery. Highly associated with toxic shock syndrome.
- Type 3, Gram-negative marine pathogens: *Aeromonas hydrophila* in fresh water, *Vibrio vulnificus* from seawater or oysters/clams. Risk factor for these is specifically liver disease and alcoholism.

## Antimicrobial Therapy for Erysipelas and Cellulitis
### Considerations

- Most cases require empiric coverage of MSSA and Group A Strep.
- Do not target CA-MRSA in nonpurulent, uncomplicated cellulitis without high suspicion for such.
- Initial duration should be 7-14 days.
- PO route can be done if afebrile for 2 days, improving cellulitis, falling CRP
- Adjust according to cultures, but start broad.

### Oral Regimens

| Drug        | Regimen                 | Coverage  |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| Cephalexin  | 500 mg PO QID           | GAS, MSSA |
| TMP-SMX     | 1-2 DS tabs divided BID | MRSA      |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg PO BID           | MRSA      |
| Amox-clav   |                         |           |
| Clindamycin (for true penicillin allergy)            |                         |           |

### Parenteral Regimens
Indicated for 2+ SIRS criteria indicating moderate-severe cellulitis, or treatment failure of oral antibiotics.

| Drug                                 | Regimen        | Coverage              |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------- | --------------------- |
| Cefazolin                            | 1 g q8h IV     | MSSA, GAS             |
| Ceftriaxone                          | 1-2 g daily IV | MSSA, GAS, other G+/- |
| Clindamycin (for penicillin allergy) |                | GAS                   |
| Vancomycin                           |                | MRSA                  |

## Medical Therapy for Necrotizing STI
1. Broad spectrum IV antibiotics.
    1. Pip-tazo 3.375g q6h IV and
    2. Clindamycin 600-900 mg IV q8h and
    3. Vancomycin/daptomycin/linezolid for MRSA coverage.
2. Fluids and aggressive resuscitation.
3. Consider IVIG if complicated by TSS.
4. Hyperbaric oxygen can be considered as an adjunct in extreme circumstances; the evidence is limited.

## Surgical Therapy for Necrotizing STI
Emergently indicated for necrotizing infections. Patients should have a second-look operation 24 hours after initial debridement.

Surgical intervention should NOT be delayed by imaging.

## Adjunct Therapy
- Reduce edema via elevation and/or compression stockings. [1]
- Treat overlying fungal infections as they present a portal of entry for pathogens.
- Sterile saline dressings on open lesions.
- Drain abscesses if significant.
