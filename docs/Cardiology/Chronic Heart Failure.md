# Chronic Heart Failure

## Current Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy \(GDMT\)

* **RAAS inhibition**
  * \(1\) ACE inhibitors
  * \(2\) ARBs
    * of note, candesartan has most evidence in HFpEF \(CHARM-PRESERVED\)
  * \(3\) ARNI
    * Studies: PARADIGM-HF \(rEF\), PARAGON-HF \(pEF\)
    * Superior to enalapril alone in reduced ejection fraction heart failure.
    * 36-hour washout required if switching between ACE/ARNI classes due to risk of angioedema
    * Current CCS guidelines have specific indications for ARNIs:
      * maximal GDMT otherwise \(ACE/ARB-based\)
      * Symptomatic from heart failure \(NYHA II-IV\)
* **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists \(MRAs\)**
  * eplerenone, spironolactone
  * studies: RALES, EPHESUS, TOPCAT \(pEF\)
  * mortality benefit in rEF, possibly in pEF but not proven due to issues in data from Russia/Georgia sites
  * Avoid in renal failure and hyperkalemia
* **Beta blockers**
  * specifically: metoprolol \(MERIT-HF\), bisoprolol, carvedilol
  * most useful in ischemic etiology
  * target HR of 70
  * metoprolol probably weakest evidence
  * initially causes symptom worsening, but improves over several months
  * least priority of any of the other GDMT therapies
