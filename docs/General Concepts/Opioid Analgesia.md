## Opioid Equianalgesic Conversion Tables
| Opioid        | Oral Morphine Mg Equivalent (MME) | Initial Adult Oral Dose |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Morphine      | 1                            | 5-20 mg q4h             |
| Hydromorphone | 5                            | 1-4 mg po q4h           |
| Codeine       | 0.15                         | 15-60mg q4h             |
| Oxycodone     | 1.5                          | 5-10 mg q4h             | 

## Common Opioids
### Morphine
The gold standard for comparing all other opioids' effectiveness and adverse reactions. Generally considered the first-choice opioid.

M3G and M6G metabolites are renally cleared, and theoretically contribute to toxicity and adverse effects. Binds purely to mu receptors.

### Hydromorphone
Consider this more strongly in renal disease as relatively lower concentration of renally cleared metabolites is produced.

### Codeine
This is ineffective in 10% of people, particularly Caucasians, due to lack of necessary enzymes to metabolize codeine to morphine.

### Oxymorphone
Less histamine release, reducing the risk of pruritis or hives.

### Hydrocodone
### Tramadol
Risk for serotonin syndrome and other toxicity due to inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake. **Avoid with MAO inhibitors, SSRIs, SNRIs**.

### Fentanyl
### Methadone

## Opioid Toxicity
Signs:

- myoclonus
- decreased respiratory rate
- miosis
