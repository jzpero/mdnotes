# Delirium
## Definition

Clinical dx of **acute, fluctuating confusion/cognitive change**.
Classically consists of **attention deficit** with other symptoms such as altered sleep-wake cycles, hallucinations, delusions, changes in affect, and autonomic symptoms.
Can be **hyperactive** or **hypoactive**.

## Risk Factors
Major RF are age (65+), baseline cognitive dysfunction or dementia, sensory deprivation, poor overall health, infection and acute illness, surgery, pain.

## Outcomes
High mortality risk, about 25-33% in-hospital.

## Pathogenesis
Occurs from widespread disturbances in cortical and subcortical brain regions with diffuse cerebral dysfunction. This is a result of an **insult to a predisposed individual**.

## Etiology
| Category        | Example                                                                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **D**rugs       | Rx drugs, overdose/abuse, poisoning/toxidrome                                           |
| **I**nfection   | Pneumonia, UTI, skin, CNS, etc.                                                         |
| **M**etabolic   | electrolytes, glucose, temperature, oxygenation, liver and renal, thyroid, vitamins, hydration, nutrition |
| **E**nvironment | hospitalization, poor vision, etc.                                                      |
| **S**tructural  | CNS lesions, strokes, etc.                                                                                        |

Pay particular attention to:

- anticholinergics, narcotics, benzodiazepines
- drugs of abuse
- lytes and glucose
- calcium
- liver and renal status
- dehydration
- ANY infection
- thyroid
- end of life
- seizures

## Assessment
The **Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)** is a 4-question screen for delirium. It requires (1) and (2). It is 82% sens and 99% spec for delirium.
   

-   (1) acute onset and fluctuating course;
-   (2) inattention with either (3) or (4);
-   (3) disorganized thinking;
-   (4) altered LOC.

Important to assess:
| Feature                | Description                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Baseline mental status | changes from the baseline? predisposition? timeframe?                  |
| inattention            | WORLD in reverse, serial 7's,  vigilance tests such as tapping fingers |
| level of consciousness | e.g. via RASS score                                                    |
| fluctuation            | must fluctuate over course of the day                                  |
| confusion              | reduced "awareness" or "clouded sensorium"                             |
| collateral             |                                                                        |
| perceptual disturbance | hallucinations or delusions                                            |
| perseveration          |                                                                        |
| orientation            |                                                                        |
