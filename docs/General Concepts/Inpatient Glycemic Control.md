# Inpatient Glycemic Control
## Consequences

- hypoglycemia
    - catacholaminergic state (arrhythmias, cardiac events)
    - transient cognitive deficits (falls, aspiration)
    - mortality
- hyperglycemia
    - catabolic state
    - electrolyte and fluid imbalances

## Glycemic Targets for Hospitalized Diabetics
| Population                 | BG Target (mM)                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Noncritically ill          | preprandial: 5.0-8.0; random: < 10.0 |
| Critically ill             | 6.0-10.0                             |
| Perioperatively (non-CABG) | 5.0-10.0                             |
| Acute coronary syndrome    | 7.0-10.0                             |
| L&D                        | 4.0-7.0                              | 

- consider lower targets if stable with Hx of successful tight outpatient glycemic control
- consider higher targets if terminally ill or with severe comorbidities
- modify antihyperglycemic therapy if BG < 3.9 unless easily explained (e.g. missed meal)

## Glucose Monitoring

If indicated, then the frequency should be about:

- fating, AC, and HS if eating;
- q4-6 h if NPO or with continuous enteral feeding;
- q1-2 h if on continuous IV insulin or critically ill.

Consider monitoring on glucose-altering interventions (glucocorticoids, octreotide, parenteral or enteral nutrition, etc).

CBG may be inaccurate in critically ill due to peripheral hypoperfusion.

## SC Insulin
### Basal

- must continue in T1DM due to risk of DKA
- continue for insulin-dependent T2DM
- new basal insulin dose is about 0.2-0.4 u/kg/d, as either NPH Q12H or glargine/degludec/detemir 

### Bolus

- should be a rapid-acting insulin analogue (aspart, lispro, glulisine), approx 0.05-0.1 u/kg/day if starting new, or 1/6 of TDD each

### Correctional

- used in addition to basal + bolus to titrate control
- dose may vary according to degree of insulin resistance
- should be the same type of insulin as the bolus
- can be used to start or bridge insulin therapy in T2DM with Q6H regular insulin, correct marked nocturnal hyperglycemia, etc.

## IV Insulin

## NPO

-   T1DM - continue basal insulin at 75-100% of current dose depending on control
-   T2DM - continue basal insulin at 25-75% of current dose depending on control
-   No prandial insulin, obviously

## Oral Antihyperglycemics

## Corticosteroids
   
-   Hyperglycemia develops in 20-50% of people without previous hx of DM on corticosteroids
-   Consider monitoring BG for 48 hours after initiating steroids w/wo hx of DM
-   Can be treated with basal-bolus regimen as above
