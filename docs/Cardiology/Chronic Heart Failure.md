# Chronic Heart Failure
## Current Initial Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF

These sets of therapies specifically target mortality benefit in HFrEF (LVEF < 40%). These notes will be updated to the 2021 CCS Guidelines[^*]. The following four classes of medications should all be initiated shortly after diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and uptitrated aggressively as symptoms and clinical condition allow.

1. RAAS inhibition
2. Beta-blockade
3. Mineralocorticoid antagonism
4. SGLT2 inhibition

### RAAS Inhibition
These consist of the ACE inhibitors (e.g. enalapril, ramipril, captopril, perindopril, trandalopril, lisinopril), ARBs (e.g. candesartan, valsartan, irbesartan), and ARNIs (sacubitril-valsartan). Mechanism likely involves targeting the cardiomyocyte remodeling process.

**ARNIs** have taken the forefront of treatment recommendations. Groundbreaking studies (**PARADIGM-HF** for HFrEF) confirmed their efficacy in chronic heart failure and superiority over maximal enalapril. **PARAGON-HF**, for HFpEF, was not a positive trial. 

!!! fyi "Current 2021 CCS Recommendations for ARNIs"
    1. Switch to ARNI during hospitalizations for acute decompensated HF.
    2. Switch to ARNI if symptomatic on previous triple-GDMT with an ACEi or ARB.
    3. Initiate therapy with ARNIs when starting treatment for new HFrEF
    4. Maintain a 36-hr washout period when switching from an ACEi; no such period is needed for ARBs. This is to reduce risk of angioedema.

*Starting dose of sacubitril-valsartan (Entresto®) is 50-100 mg BID (dose rounded). Target dose is 200 mg BID (dose rounded).*

### Beta-blockers
These include metoprolol CR/XL (**MERIT-HF**[^%]), bisoprolol (**CIBIS-II**[^!]), and carvedilol (**Carvedilol HF Study**[^$] and **COPERNICUS**[^#]). The version of metoprolol available in Canada, the immediate-release version, was not investigated in these seminal trials.

Likely most useful in HF of ischemic etiology. Target a HR of 70.

### Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists
These consists of the drugs spironolactone (Aldactone®) and eplerenone. The key difference between these two is that spironolactone has an adverse effect of painful gynecomastia, and eplerenone should be used if this develops. These can cause hyperkalemia as well.

Key studies showing mortality benefit for these medications include **RALES**[^&] for heart failure and **EPHESUS**[^^] for post-MI with LV dysfunction.

### SGLT2 Inhibitors
These medications have taken the nephrology and cardiology world by storm in the setting of CKD and HF. They serve double-duty as oral antihyperglycemics in diabetic patients and should be strongly considered in that setting.

- **Canagliflozin** (Invokana)
- **Empagliflozin** (Jardiance)
- **Dapagliflozin** (Farxiga)

## Medical Therapy for HFpEF
No medications have had a clear positive impact on mortality in HFpEF. The disease is strongly linked to its underlying predisposing conditions, and optimization of these is likely to provide the best benefit. However, the following may be the best therapy for HFpEF:

1. **Candesartan** which showed a hospitalization benefit in CHARM-Preserved.
2. **Spironolactone** which showed a hospitalization benefit in TOPCAT. There may be a mortality benefit here as well, but issues with Russian/Georgian data in the trial preclude a clear statement of benefit.
